Project Overview: Quantifying the Post-2007 Election Impact on Kenya
This project conducts a rigorous statistical analysis using time-series data to quantify the socio-economic shock following the 2007 Kenyan General Elections.

The study aims to estimate the precise magnitude and duration of the regression in key national indicators, such as Quarterly GDP Growth and Tourism Revenue.

By utilizing a three-language approach, we demonstrate mastery of statistical computing workflows:

Python (folder_one): Used for efficient Data Acquisition, Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

R (folder_two): Used for Advanced Statistical Modeling (e.g., ARIMA) and generating high-quality, interpretive visualizations.

Julia (folder_three): Used for Computational Benchmarking and High-Performance Simulation to model the post-shock recovery dynamics.

The findings provide crucial data-driven insights for risk assessment and policy planning for future periods of potential political instability in Kenya.
